# Overview

This is a Kotlin project that builds a Dungeon and Dragons (D&D)
model using object-oriented programming principles. It implements
the rules of Edition 5 and its 2024/2025 revision.

# Implementation Guide

- See rules on Unit Tests in doc/unit_tests.md
- We have documented all architectural decisions in doc/decisions.md
- Whenever you make changes to a source file, consult the intellij MCP afterwards with
  `get_file_problems` to observe if any problems were introduced.
- Prefer using IntelliJ MCP tools (`get_run_configurations` and `execute_run_configuration`)
  to run unit tests instead of calling `./gradlew` directly.
